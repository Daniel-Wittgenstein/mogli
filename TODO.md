- detecting infinite loops?

- in dark mode the stats bar slightly overlaps scrollbar in certain window sizes
    (test with dark theme and fullscreen)

- syntax highlighting

- implement the features main.js has but we haven't yet (mostly copying
them into moglimanager)

- multiline comments break because of auto-inserted tag. forbid them, strip them
    or fix the tag insertion. stripping would be best

- inky seems to group tags, so normal command tag gets merged with
auto-inserted tag in the next line. -> or maybe it was incorrectly
parsing tags because they contained speicle characters? not sure. to check.
see if it's fixed with the new line number format

- image data to html insert (-> also at runtime)

a- variable set reactor functions

b- every turn js + ink function (?)

c- choosepathstring -> goto knot wrapper

- reasonable user wrapper variable for a/b/c (mogli or whatever)

- tests
