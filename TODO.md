- detecting infinite loops?

- in dark mode the stats bar slightly overlaps scrollbar in certain window sizes
    (test with dark theme and fullscreen)

- syntax highlighting

- implement the features main.js has but we haven't yet (mostly copying
them into moglimanager)

- multiline comments break because of auto-inserted tag. forbid them, strip them
    or fix the tag insertion

- inky seems to group tags, so normal command tag gets merged with
auto-inserted tag in the next line.
