# For developers and other people who want to hack Mogli

If you have a lot of experience with npm/node/JS you know what to do anyway.

The following is meant for people with little to medium experience in JavaScript who still want to try their hand at hacking the Mogli editor and/or runtime.

## Setup

Download Mogli as a zip file from Github and unzip. Or clone the GitHub repo.

## Testing Mogli

Because of CORS policy, you cannot just open the app in your browser.
Instead you should start a local server. There are several ways to do this.
If you have Python3 installed, it can be as easy as navigating to the top Mogli directory and
typing this in the terminal:
    python3 -m http.server

The terminal should respond with something similar to:
    Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/)

Open http://0.0.0.0:8000/ in your browser and the app should work.

## Changing the editor

If you change the Mogli editor files, you do not even have to rebuild the project.
The changes should just show in your browser (after you hit F5/refresh, of course).

## Changing the Mogli runtime files

The folder "runtime" contains the files that are needed for the actual game to run.
If you change these files, you need to **rebuild** the project before you can see the changes in the browser. How to build the project:

1. Install node, if you don't have it already.

2. **in the top Mogli directory**, type into your terminal:
    $ node build-runtime-data.js

3. View changes in the browser.

## Building and refreshing the browser in one

There are of course many ways to do this. Currently I am using a very simple Linux bash script similar to this:

    #!/bin/bash
    /home/user/.nvm/versions/node/v16.13.1/bin/node whatever-path-you-put-mogli-in/location-of-mogli/build-runtime-data.js &&
    wmctrl -a "- Google Chrome" &&
    xdotool sleep 0.2 &&
    xdotool key F5

On other OSes, of course, you would have to do it differently.
